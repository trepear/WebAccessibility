# WebAccessibility

This webpage touches on online marketing, but its content is not pertinent to this project. The project here was to make the webpage more accessible to users through the use of semantic HTML elements and comments within the HTML/CSS.

I went through index.html and changed all the non-descrptive HTML tags to more descriptive ones.
Additionally, all images come with a tag describing what they look like. Lastly, I inserted comments above each section of the webpage to describe what part of the webpage will be shown in the subsequent HTML code to the user. In style.css, I wrote comments above nearly every property in order to further describe the overall aesthetic of the webpage.

This webpage should now be more accessible to all users!
