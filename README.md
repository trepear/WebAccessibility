# WebAccessibility

This webpage touches on online marketing. The project here was to make the webpage more accessible to users.

I went through index.html and changed all the non-descrptive HTML tags to more descriptive ones.
Additionally, all images come with a tag describing what they look like. Lastly, I inserted comments above each section of the webpage to describe what part of the webpage will be shown in the subsequent HTML code to the user. In style. css, I wrote a comment that described the general layout of the webpage.

This webpage should now be more accessible to all users!
